# Overview
This seminar project aims to explore simple formal verification techniques using the Idris programming language. By leveraging Idris's advanced type system and support for dependent types, the project seeks to demonstrate how formal methods can ensure the correctness and reliability of software components. Through practical implementations and case studies, it will illustrate the benefits and challenges of applying formal verification in real-world scenarios, fostering a deeper understanding of its role in enhancing software quality and reducing errors.
